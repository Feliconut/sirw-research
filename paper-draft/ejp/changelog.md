1. Overhauled proof of Prop. 2.4, especially the definition of good event, in a manner more consistent with [Kosygina and Peterson, 2016, "Periodic"]. Specifically, a global good event is defined instead of good events specific to an excursion time (x,m).
2. Made various revisions to the writing and wording of Prop. 2.4. It can now be treated as a standalone working proof and we can start to consider how to present it better in paper.
3. One hole to be filled: the uniform control of local times is a nontrivial lemma that needs to be proved. Not previous proven for SIRW, but has counterpart (**Lemma 3.4**, [Kosygina and Peterson, 2016, "Periodic"]).

1. Transferred proof of prop. 2.1 and 2.4 to this draft.
2. Added detailed justification of good event $G_K$.

Further revision is needed.
