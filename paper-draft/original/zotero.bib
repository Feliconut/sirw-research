  abstract = {We describe scaling limits of recurrent excited random walks (ERWs) on Z in i.i.d. cookie environments with a bounded number of cookies per site. We allow both positive and negative excitations. It is known that ERW is recurrent if and only if the expected total drift per site, {$\delta$}, belongs to the interval [-1, 1]. We show that if |{$\delta$}| {$<$} 1 then the diffusively scaled ERW under the averaged measure converges to a ({$\delta$}, -{$\delta$})perturbed Brownian motion. In the boundary case, |{$\delta$}| = 1, the space scaling has to be adjusted by an extra logarithmic term, and the weak limit of ERW happens to be a constant multiple of the running maximum of the standard Brownian motion, a transient process.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We introduce a family of stochastic processes on the integers, depending on a parameter                              and interpolating between the deterministic rotor walk (                              ) and the simple random walk (                              ). This               p-rotor walk               is not a Markov chain but it has a               local               Markov property: for each                              the sequence of successive exits from                              is a Markov chain. The main result of this paper identifies the scaling limit of the p-rotor walk with two-sided i.i.d. initial rotors. The limiting process takes the form                              , where                              is a doubly perturbed Brownian motion, that is, it satisfies the implicit equation                                                   urn:x-wiley:10429832:media:rsa20747:rsa20747-math-0008                                               for all                              . Here                              is a standard Brownian motion and                              are constants depending on the marginals of the initial rotors on                              and                              respectively. Chaumont and Doney have shown that Equation 1 has a pathwise unique solution                              , and that the solution is almost surely continuous and adapted to the natural filtration of the Brownian motion. Moreover,                              and                              . This last result, together with the main result of this paper, implies that the p-rotor walk is recurrent for any two-sided i.i.d. initial rotors and any                              .},
