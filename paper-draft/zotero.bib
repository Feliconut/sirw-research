  abstract = {We use generalized Ray-Knight theorems introduced by B\textbackslash 'alint T\textbackslash 'oth in 1996 together with techniques developed for excited random walks as main tools for establishing positive and negative results concerning convergence of some classes of diffusively scaled self-interacting random walks (SIRWs) to Brownian motions perturbed at extrema (BMPE). T\textbackslash 'oth's work studied two classes of SIRWs: asymptotically free and polynomially self-repelling walks. For both classes Toth has shown, in particular, that the distribution function of a scaled SIRW observed at independent geometric times converges to that of a BMPE indicated by the generalized Ray-Knight theorem for this SIRW. The question of weak convergence of one-dimensional distributions of scaled SIRW remained open. In this paper, on the one hand, we prove a full functional limit theorem for a large class of asymptotically free SIRWs which includes asymptotically free walks considered in T\textbackslash 'oth's paper. On the other hand, we show that rescaled polynomially self-repelling SIRWs do not converge to the BMPE predicted by the corresponding generalized Ray-Knight theorems and, hence, do not converge to any BMPE.},

  abstract = {We consider one-dimensional excited random walks (ERWs) with periodic cookie stacks in the recurrent regime. We prove functional limit theorems for these walks which extend the previous results in [DK12] for [[excited random walk]]s with ``boundedly many cookies per site.'' In particular, in the non-boundary recurrent case the rescaled excited random walk converges in the standard Skorokhod topology to a Brownian motion perturbed at its extrema (BMPE). While BMPE is a natural limiting object for excited random walks with boundedly many cookies per site, it is far from obvious why the same should be true for our model which allows for infinitely many ``cookies'' at each site. Moreover, a BMPE has two parameters {$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} {$<$} 1 and the scaling limits in this paper cover a larger variety of choices for {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} than can be obtained for ERWs with boundedly many cookies per site.},
